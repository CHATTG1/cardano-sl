# Introduction<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

# Abstract<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

The purpose of this document is to review security model in communication
 between wallet backend and wallet frontend (Daedalus).

# Motivation<a id="sec-3" name="sec-3"></a>

Communication between wallet frontend (Daedalus) and wallet backend in cardano
 is done via http server. There are various attacks possible to this kind of 
environmnet (TODO footnote or further list of possible attack vectors needed).

# Current design<a id="sec-4" name="sec-4"></a>

This summarises current approach in server-client communication.

-   wallet server has https server (based on TLS CA server cert) set up and listening on specific IP:PORT
    
-   client is using its on pair of CA certificate in order to verify server cert when sending request to server

Downsides:

-   any other user on the same machine can connect to the wallet backend. If there's no spending password they can also spend

# Proposed design<a id="sec-5" name="sec-5"></a>

From https://iohk.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/DEVOPS-103:

-   to defend against the most obvious of impersonation attacks, we need the wallet's frontend and backend to mutually authenticate to each other

-   the previous scheme, partly based on TLS CA server cert (provided by the backend) and the authentication password (provided by the frontend, CSM-100) was deemed too be unnecessarily hostile to the user (who had to remember Yet Another Password)

-   previous point means we have to make do with a non-interactive mutual authentication scheme

-   PKI provides us with such a scheme â€“ the CA might be used to sign both the backend key/certificate pair (which we already do in DEVOPS-33/CSM-116) and the frontend key/certificate pair


The proposal is to implement this scheme:

-   Instead of three artifacts (CA cert, backend key, backend cert), the installer will generate five (+frontend key, +frontend cert) - already implemented

-   The frontend will have to provide the cert to the backend

-   The backend will switch from ignoring the client certificate to requiring a valid one to be provided
